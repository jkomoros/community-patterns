# Pattern Launcher CLI

Quick interactive tool to deploy CommonTools patterns without typing long bash commands.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ~/Code/community-patterns
./tools/launch.ts
```

## Features

- 🚀 **One-command deployment** - No more long bash commands
- 🎯 **Remembers deployment target** - localhost or production (defaults to last used)
- 📝 **Separate space history** - Tracks last space per deployment target
- 📋 **Pattern history** - Recently used patterns at your fingertips
- 📁 **Interactive directory browser** - Navigate and pick patterns visually
- ⬆️⬇️ **Arrow key navigation** - Use ↑/↓ and Enter to select, no typing numbers
- 🔗 **Full URL output** - Get clickable charm URL immediately
- ⚙️ **Auto-configuration** - Detects labs directory automatically
- ⚡ **Quick repeat** - Just hit Enter 3 times to repeat last deployment

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
./tools/launch.ts
```

This will:
1. Prompt for deployment target (localhost or production - remembers last choice)
2. Prompt for space name (suggests last space for that target)
3. Show recent patterns or let you browse
4. Deploy the pattern
5. Print the full URL with charm ID
6. Exit immediately

**Quick repeat workflow:** Hit Enter on each prompt to use defaults:
- Enter → (use last deployment target)
- Enter → (use last space for that target)
- Enter → (use last pattern)
- Pattern deploys in seconds!

## Interactive Flow

### Deployment Target Selection (First Question)

```
🚀 Pattern Launcher

Select deployment target (↑/↓ to move, Enter to select):

→ 💻 localhost:8000 (last used)
  🌐 production (api.commontools.io)

[Use arrow keys, press Enter]
```

The tool remembers your last choice and shows it first, so you can just press Enter to repeat.

### Space Selection

```
Select space (↑/↓ to move, Enter to select):

→ alex-1119-1 (last used)
  alex-1120-1 (today)
  alex-1119-2 (next)
  ✨ Enter new space name...

[Use arrow keys, press Enter]
```

Each deployment target (localhost/production) has its own separate space history.

The tool intelligently suggests the next space name:
- If last space was `alex-1119-1` → suggests `alex-1119-2` (increments trailing number)
- If last space was `alex-1119` → suggests `alex-1119-1` (appends `-1`)
- If last space was `test-space` → suggests `test-space-1`

### Pattern Selection

```
📋 Select a pattern (↑/↓ to move, Enter to select, Q to quit):

→ 📄 cozy-poll.tsx  (community-patterns/jkomoros/WIP) (5 min ago)
  📄 group-voter.tsx  (recipes/alex) (yesterday)
  📄 shopping-list.tsx  (labs/examples) (3 days ago)
  📁 Browse for a new pattern...

[Use arrow keys to highlight, press Enter to select]
```

### Directory Browser

Select "Browse for a new pattern...":

```
📂 Quick navigate to a recent folder, or browse:
(↑/↓ to move, Enter to select, Q to cancel)

→ 📁 ~/Code/community-patterns/patterns/jkomoros/WIP/
  📁 ~/Code/recipes/patterns/alex/
  📁 ~/Code/labs/patterns/examples/
  🔍 Browse from patterns/ directory...

[Select a recent folder to jump there, or browse to navigate manually]
```

If you select a recent folder, you jump directly there. If you select "Browse from patterns/ directory...", you get the full directory tree:

```
📁 /path/to/community-patterns/patterns/
(↑/↓ to move, Enter to select, Q to cancel)

→ ⬆️  .. (Go up one directory)
  📁 examples
  📁 jkomoros
  📁 yourname
  ✏️  Enter absolute path manually...

[Use arrow keys, press Enter when on "yourname"]
```

Navigate into directories:

```
📁 /path/to/community-patterns/patterns/yourname/
(↑/↓ to move, Enter to select, Q to cancel)

→ 📁 WIP
  📄 my-stable-pattern.tsx
  ⬆️  .. (Go up one directory)
  ✏️  Enter absolute path manually...

[Use arrow keys, press Enter when on "WIP"]
```

Pick a pattern:

```
📁 /path/to/community-patterns/patterns/yourname/WIP/
(↑/↓ to move, Enter to select, Q to cancel)

→ 📄 cozy-poll.tsx
  📄 experimental-chat.tsx
  ⬆️  .. (Go up one directory)
  ✏️  Enter absolute path manually...

[Press Enter to select cozy-poll.tsx]
```

### Deployment Output

```
🚀 Deploying...
  Pattern: cozy-poll.tsx  (community-patterns/jkomoros/WIP)
  Space: my-space
  API: http://localhost:8000
  Identity: /path/to/claude.key

[deployment output...]

✅ Deployed successfully!

🔗 http://localhost:8000/my-space/abc123-def456-ghi789

[exits immediately - copy/paste URL to browser]
```

## Configuration

The tool stores its configuration in `.launcher-config` at the repository root (gitignored).

**Config file structure:**
```json
{
  "lastSpaceLocal": "test-jkomoros-1",
  "lastSpaceProd": "prod-jkomoros-1",
  "lastDeploymentTarget": "local",
  "labsDir": "/custom/path/to/labs",
  "patterns": [
    {
      "path": "/path/to/pattern.tsx",
      "lastUsed": "2025-01-19T12:34:56.789Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Labs Directory Detection

The tool automatically detects your labs directory:

1. **First try:** `../labs` (relative to community-patterns)
2. **If not found:** Prompts you to enter the path
3. **Saves it:** Stores custom path in config for future runs

### Identity Key

Uses `claude.key` from the community-patterns root directory.

If you need a different identity key location, you'll need to modify `IDENTITY_PATH` in `launch.ts`.

## Space Naming

The tool provides smart space name suggestions based on your last used space **for that deployment target** (localhost and production track spaces separately).

**Increment Logic:**
- `alex-1119-1` → `alex-1119-2` (increments last number)
- `test-space-5` → `test-space-6` (increments last number)
- `alex-1119` → `alex-1119-1` (appends `-1`, doesn't treat 1119 as an index)
- `test-space` → `test-space-1` (appends `-1`)

**Date-based spaces:**
- If your last space was `alex-1119-1` and today is November 20, you'll see `alex-1120-1 (today)` as a suggestion
- Counter resets to 1 when the date changes

**Options:**
1. **Last used** - Reuse the same space (useful for quick iterations)
2. **Today** - Today's date with counter 1 (if date changed from last use)
3. **Next** - Auto-incremented space name (useful for sequential testing)
4. **Custom** - Enter a completely new space name

**Separate tracking:** localhost might remember `test-jkomoros-3` while production remembers `prod-jkomoros-1`, so you never mix contexts!

## Smart Directory Navigation

The browse feature learns from your pattern history and shows recently used directories first:

**Benefits:**
- Jump directly to folders you use frequently
- Skip navigation if you're working in the same area
- Saves time on repetitive deployments

**How it works:**
- Extracts unique directories from your last 50 pattern uses
- Shows up to 10 most recently used folders
- Option to browse manually if you need a new location

**Example:**
If you've been working in `patterns/jkomoros/WIP/`, that folder appears as a quick option next time you browse. Just press Enter to jump there!

## Pattern Display Format

Patterns are shown with the filename first, followed by context tags:

```
pattern-name.tsx  (repo/username/WIP) (time ago)
```

**Examples:**
- `cozy-poll.tsx  (community-patterns/jkomoros/WIP)` - Work in progress
- `group-voter.tsx  (recipes/alex)` - Stable pattern
- `shopping-list.tsx  (labs/examples)` - Example pattern

**Context tags include:**
- **Repository:** Which repo the pattern is in (labs, recipes, community-patterns, etc.)
- **Username:** Which user's namespace (patterns/username/)
- **WIP:** Only shown if pattern is in a WIP/ directory

This format lets you quickly scan pattern names while still seeing important context!

## Pattern History

- **Stores:** Last 50 patterns used
- **Shows:** Most recent 10 in the main menu
- **Sorts:** Most recently used first
- **Time format:** "5 min ago", "yesterday", "3 days ago"

## Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ↑ | Move selection up |
| ↓ | Move selection down |
| Enter | Confirm selection |
| Q | Quit/cancel current menu |
| Ctrl-C | Exit immediately |

The currently selected item is highlighted with:
- `→` arrow indicator on the left
- Reverse video (inverted colors)

## Tips

- **Quick re-deploy:** Just hit Enter on space name, then use arrow keys to pick from recent list
- **Arrow key navigation:** Use ↑/↓ to move through options, Enter to select
- **Visual feedback:** The → arrow and reverse video show your current selection
- **Go up:** Navigate to ".. (Go up one directory)" option to go back
- **Manual path:** Navigate to "Enter absolute path manually..." if you know the exact path
- **Quit anytime:** Press `Q` to cancel, or `Ctrl-C` to exit immediately

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not find labs directory"

The tool couldn't find labs at the default location (`../labs`). You'll be prompted to enter the path manually.

### "❌ Deployment failed"

Check that:
- Dev servers are running (toolshed on port 8000)
- Identity key exists at repository root
- Pattern file is valid TypeScript/TSX

### "❌ File not found"

The pattern file path doesn't exist. Double-check the path when browsing manually.

## Files
