# ISSUE: ~40 Second Delay with navigateTo + person.tsx + generateObject

## Summary

When `navigateTo(Person({ notes }))` creates a person charm with **long notes containing many extractable fields** (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.), subsequent `generateObject` extraction causes a **~40 second delay** before the modal appears.

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED (2025-12-17)

### The Smoking Gun: navigateTo's Schema Wrapping Creates False Dependencies

**File:** `/Users/alex/Code/labs/packages/runner/src/builtins/navigate-to.ts` line 46

```typescript
const inputsWithLog = inputsCell.asSchema({ not: true, asCell: true }).withTx(tx);
```

**Why this causes the freeze:**

1. **navigateTo creates schema-wrapped charm** → registered as single "read" dependency
2. **generateObject makes ~40 incremental writes** (streaming result updates)
3. **Each write triggers scheduler's overlap checking** against the entire charm structure
4. **40 writes × O(n²) path overlap checking = ~40 seconds**

### Key Files Involved

| File | Line | Issue |
|------|------|-------|
| `navigate-to.ts` | 46 | Schema wrapping creates false entity-level dependencies |
| `runner.ts` | 1222-1229 | `findAllWriteRedirectCells` returns entire charm |
| `scheduler.ts` | 619 | Sequential `await this.run(fn)` with no event loop yielding |
| `reactive-dependencies.ts` | - | O(n²) path overlap checking in `determineTriggeredActions` |
| `cache.ts` | 1057 | 60-second `syncTimeout` in Replica |

### Flow Comparison

| Phase | Direct Deployment | navigateTo Path |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Charm Creation | No intermediate wrapping | Schema wraps Person charm |
| Dependency Setup | Granular field subscriptions | **Entire charm** as single dependency |
| generateObject Writes | Minimal path checking | **40+ overlap checks against full charm** |
| Total Time | ~1-2 seconds | **~40 seconds** |

### Why Direct Deployment is Fast

When you deploy a charm directly with `charm new` and manually type notes:
- Each field is individually tracked
- generateObject writes only trigger checking for that specific field
- No schema-wrapped entity-level dependency

### Why navigateTo is Slow

When you use `navigateTo(Person({ notes }))`:
- The charm is created with `asSchema({ not: true, asCell: true })` wrapping
- This registers the entire charm as a single "read" dependency
- Every generateObject write triggers path overlap checking against ALL fields
- With ~40 streaming writes, this becomes O(n²) total

## ⚠️ Previous Update (2025-12-17 Late Session)

### CTAutoLayout is a RED HERRING - NOT the root cause!

**Test performed:** Created `person-no-autolayout.tsx` - exact copy of person.tsx with `<cf-autolayout>` replaced by simple `<div>`.

| Test | cf-autolayout? | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| person.tsx via navigateTo | YES | **~40 second FREEZE** |
| person-no-autolayout.tsx via navigateTo | NO | **~40 second FREEZE** |

**The freeze still happens WITHOUT cf-autolayout!** The TypeError in CTAutoLayout.render() is a symptom of the freeze, not the cause.

---

## Critical Discovery: navigateTo vs Direct Deployment

| Deployment Method | Notes Entry | Extract Result |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `charm new` (direct) | Manual typing | **INSTANT** |
| `navigateTo(Person({ notes }))` | Pre-populated via props | **~40 second FREEZE** |

**The exact same person.tsx code behaves completely differently depending on how the charm is created!**

- Direct deployment + manual typing → FAST
- navigateTo with props → FREEZE

---

## Remaining Hypotheses (after ruling out cf-autolayout)

### 1. storageManager.synced() blocking (HIGH CONFIDENCE)

**File:** `/Users/alex/Code/labs/packages/shell/src/runtime.ts` lines 216-232

```typescript
runtime.storageManager.synced().then(async () => {  // 40-SECOND BLOCKING WAIT?
  const charms = charmManager.getCharms().get()
  // ... add charm to list
  // ... then navigate
})
```

navigateTo's shell callback waits for storage sync before adding charm to list. This could be the 40-second wait.

### 2. O(n²) in topologicalSort (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)

**File:** `/Users/alex/Code/labs/packages/runner/src/scheduler.ts` lines 650-670

The scheduler's topologicalSort has O(n²) complexity for building the dependency graph. With many cells updating at once (generateObject result), this could cause significant delay.

### 3. O(n) storage reads in normalizeAndDiff (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)

**File:** `/Users/alex/Code/labs/packages/runner/src/data-updating.ts` lines 158-191

ID_FIELD matching loop does storage reads per array element. With large arrays, this compounds.

---

## Previous Hypothesis (DISPROVEN)

### ~~Root Cause Identified: CTAutoLayout.render() Error Loop~~

~~**File:** `/Users/alex/Code/labs/packages/ui/src/v2/components/cf-autolayout/cf-autolayout.ts`~~
~~**Line:** 578~~

**DISPROVEN:** Removing cf-autolayout did NOT fix the freeze. The TypeError is a symptom, not the cause.

**Console error during freeze:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at CTAutoLayout.render
```

This error appears DURING the freeze because the component's state is corrupted by whatever is actually causing the freeze.
- CTAutoLayout tries to render before `tabNames` prop is bound
- Direct deployment has simpler initialization → props are stable before render

---

## Previous Root Cause Hypothesis (Partially Correct)

**The bug is triggered by the NUMBER OF FIELDS being extracted, not by navigateTo() or person.tsx complexity.**

### Critical Discovery

| Notes Content | Fields Extracted | Result |
|---------------|------------------|--------|
| Short (6 lines, no social) | ~6 fields | **FAST (instant)** |
| Long (with Twitter, LinkedIn) | ~9 fields | **SLOW (~30s)** |

The same launcher, same person.tsx, same navigateTo() - the ONLY difference is the demo notes content.

## Reproduction

### Slow Path (~30 seconds)
```typescript
// Notes with Twitter/LinkedIn trigger the bug
const DEMO_NOTES = `Dr. Maya Rodriguez (she/her)
maya.rodriguez@biotech.com
+1-617-555-7890
Born: 1988-11-03
Twitter: @drmayar
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/maya-rodriguez

Biotech researcher specializing in CRISPR gene editing...`;

navigateTo(Person({ notes: DEMO_NOTES }))
// Then click "Extract Data from Notes" → ~30s delay
```

### Fast Path (instant)
```typescript
// Notes WITHOUT Twitter/LinkedIn are fast
const DEMO_NOTES = `Dr. Maya Rodriguez (she/her)
maya.rodriguez@biotech.com
+1-617-555-7890
Born: 1988-11-03

Biotech researcher at GeneTech Labs.`;

navigateTo(Person({ notes: DEMO_NOTES }))
// Then click "Extract Data from Notes" → instant
```

## Evidence (2025-12-17 Testing)

| Scenario | Notes | Extraction Time |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Direct `charm new` of person.tsx | manual entry | ~5-10 seconds |
| navigateTo + short notes (6 fields) | short | **instant** |
| navigateTo + long notes (9 fields) | long | **~30 seconds** |
| person-debug.tsx (copy) + short notes | short | **instant** |
| person-debug.tsx (copy) + long notes | short | **instant** |

## Key Findings

### What DOES Trigger the Bug
- `navigateTo(Person({ notes: LONG_NOTES }))` where LONG_NOTES extracts 8+ fields
- The extraction modal (`changesPreview.map()`) with many items
- Specifically the Notes diff rendering (`notesDiffChunks.map()`)

### What Does NOT Trigger the Bug
- Direct deployment via `charm new`
- Short notes with fewer fields to extract
- `navigateTo()` itself (works fine with short notes)
- `cf-autolayout` itself (works fine in minimal repros)
- `pattern()` wrapper (works fine in minimal repros)

### Console Observations During Delay
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` in CTAutoLayout.render
- The delay happens AFTER the LLM API returns (API is fast)
- UI freezes during the delay

## Hypothesis

The bug is in the **changesPreview modal rendering** when there are many fields to display. Specifically:
1. The `changesPreview.map()` creating many change items
2. The `notesDiffChunks.map()` rendering word-by-word diffs
3. Some interaction between `ifElse()` conditional rendering and the map iterations

The issue scales with the NUMBER of extracted fields, not the complexity of person.tsx itself.

## Investigation Log (2025-12-17 Continued)

### Attempt 1: Nested Maps with Static Data
**File:** `WIP/nested-map-perf-repro.tsx`
**Hypothesis:** O(n²) in scheduler.topologicalSort() with nested `.map()`
**Test:** 9 outer items × 5 inner items = 45 cells, button click to load
**Result:** **INSTANT** - No delay

### Attempt 2: generateObject + ifElse + Nested Maps
**File:** `WIP/generateobject-map-perf-repro.tsx`
**Hypothesis:** Combination of generateObject + ifElse branch switch + nested maps
**Test:** Mimics person.tsx flow with generateObject triggering ifElse switch to modal with nested maps
**Result:** **INSTANT** - No delay

### Attempt 3: Dynamic Cell Creation (540 items)
**File:** `WIP/dynamic-cell-creation-repro.tsx`
**Hypothesis:** O(n²) only manifests during DYNAMIC cell creation, not static
**Test:** Start empty, button click creates 9 × 60 = 540 nested items dynamically
**Result:** **INSTANT** - No delay

### Attempt 4: cf-autolayout + ifElse + Dynamic Maps (540 items)
**File:** `WIP/dynamic-cell-autolayout-repro.tsx`
**Hypothesis:** cf-autolayout component causes the freeze (CTAutoLayout.render error during freeze)
**Test:** cf-autolayout with ifElse switching between Form view and Results view with 540 dynamic items
**Result:** **INSTANT** - No delay

### Attempt 5: Properly Instrumented Repro (call counts, not handler timing)
**File:** `WIP/perf-instrumented-repro.tsx`
**Hypothesis:** We were measuring the wrong thing - handler timing only measures graph setup, not reactive execution
**Test:** Added global counters inside .map() closures to count actual render calls
**Result:** **INSTANT** - No delay, items.set() took ~481ms but reactive render was fast
**Learning:** The superstition about measuring correctly is valid, but our simplified repros genuinely ARE fast - the bug isn't a measurement artifact

### Key Finding: Our Repros Don't Reproduce the Bug

| Repro Pattern | Items | Dynamic? | Result |
|---------------|-------|----------|--------|
| nested-map-perf-repro.tsx | 45 | Yes (button) | FAST |
| generateobject-map-perf-repro.tsx | 45 | Yes (generateObject) | FAST |
| dynamic-cell-creation-repro.tsx | 540 | Yes (button) | FAST |
| dynamic-cell-autolayout-repro.tsx | 540 | Yes (button + cf-autolayout) | FAST |
| perf-instrumented-repro.tsx | 540 | Yes (button + call counting) | FAST |
| **person.tsx (real)** | ~70 | Yes (generateObject) | **~35s FREEZE** |

### What We've Ruled Out

These do NOT cause the bug (confirmed by fast repros):
- ❌ `navigateTo()` itself
- ❌ `generateObject()` alone
- ❌ `ifElse()` with nested maps
- ❌ Simple nested `.map()` operations (even 540 items)
- ❌ `pattern()` wrapper
- ❌ Dynamic cell creation in general
- ❌ O(n²) in scheduler (at least not at this scale)
- ❌ `cf-autolayout` component alone
- ❌ `cf-autolayout` + `ifElse` + dynamic maps combination

### What's Different About person.tsx?

| Aspect | person.tsx | Our Repros |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Wrapper | `pattern()` | `pattern()` |
| Field Cells | 14+ separate Cells | Single prop or few cells |
| `changesPreview` | Depends on 14 field Cells via `compareFields()` | Simple computed |
| Reactive Graph | Deep - many interdependent cells | Shallow |
| Components | `cf-autolayout`, `cf-vscroll`, `cf-screen` | Simple divs |
| Console Error | `TypeError in CTAutoLayout.render` | None |

### Suspicious Clue: CTAutoLayout Error

During the freeze, console shows:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at CTAutoLayout.render
```

This error appears repeatedly during the ~35s freeze. Could `cf-autolayout` be crashing and retrying in a loop?

---

## Next Steps

### Ruled Out (Tested):
- ~~Test with `cf-autolayout`~~ - TESTED: cf-autolayout + ifElse + 540 items = FAST

### Remaining Hypotheses:

1. **Test with `pattern()` wrapper** - Does switching from `pattern()` to `pattern()` trigger the bug?
2. **Test with many field Cells (14+)** - person.tsx has 14+ individual Cells that `changesPreview` depends on via `compareFields()`
3. **Test with deep reactive graph** - person.tsx has many interdependent computed cells
4. **Profile person.tsx directly** - Add instrumentation (call counters, not timing) to person.tsx itself
5. **Test the exact `compareFields()` + `notesDiffChunks` combination** - These may have expensive operations

### Key Insight (2025-12-17)

The bug is NOT caused by any single factor we've tested in isolation. It must be a **combination** of factors unique to person.tsx, or there's something we haven't identified yet.

Possible unexplored factors:
- The `pattern()` wrapper creating additional reactive overhead
- The `compareFields()` function doing expensive operations on every recompute
- The `computeWordDiff()` function (even though it was moved to pre-computed)
- Some interaction between navigateTo() and the charm's initialization state

## Recommended Fix

### Framework Fix (labs repo)

**File:** `/Users/alex/Code/labs/packages/ui/src/v2/components/cf-autolayout/cf-autolayout.ts`
**Line:** 578

```typescript
// Current (unsafe):
const contentTabs: string[] = (this.tabNames.length === defaults.length)

// Fixed (safe):
const tabNames = this.tabNames ?? [];
const contentTabs: string[] = (tabNames.length === defaults.length)
  ? tabNames
  : defaults.map((_, i) => `Pane ${i + 1}`);
```

### Workaround (pattern level)

Until the framework is fixed, patterns using cf-autolayout might need to ensure props are never undefined during render cycles.

## Profiling Results (2025-12-17)

### ⚠️ HYPOTHESIS PARTIALLY DISPROVEN BY PROFILING

The profiling data shows the O(n²) `arraysOverlap` hypothesis is **NOT the primary cause**:

| Metric | Value | Analysis |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **action-1 execution** | **15,956 ms** (16 seconds!) | Single action taking most of the time |
| **action-17, action-18** | 1,059 ms + 958 ms each | Two more slow actions later |
| topologicalSort-build-graph | 0.1 - 1.0 ms | **FAST** - NOT the bottleneck |
| arraysOverlap total calls | 52,776 | Many calls but still fast |
| determineTriggeredActions | 0.1 - 0.5 ms each | **FAST** - NOT the bottleneck |

### NEW ROOT CAUSE: Action Execution, Not Scheduler

The freeze is in **ACTION EXECUTION**, not the scheduler's dependency checking:

```
[PROFILING] action-1-action2: 15956.694091796875 ms  ← 16 SECONDS in one action!
[PROFILING] action-execution-loop: 16237.948974609375 ms (total)
```

The scheduler is running fast (<1ms). The problem is what happens INSIDE the action.

### What's Slow

- ❌ NOT `arraysOverlap` - runs fast even with 52k calls
- ❌ NOT `topologicalSort` - build-graph completes in <1ms
- ❌ NOT `determineTriggeredActions` - runs in 0.1-0.5ms
- ✅ **YES** - One specific action (`action2`) taking 16 seconds

### Likely Culprits (Need Further Investigation)

1. **generateObject streaming handler** - processing incremental LLM results
2. **Reactive update processing** - when extractionResult.set() is called
3. **UI rendering/diffing** - computing changesPreview or notesDiffChunks
4. **Storage operations** - writes to Automerge/storage layer

### Next Steps

1. Add profiling inside the `generateObject` builtin to see what's slow
2. Profile the `changesPreview` computed and `notesDiffChunks` computed
3. Check if storage layer operations are blocking

## Profiling Instrumentation (DO NOT COMMIT to labs)

Temporary profiling added to labs repo:

| File | Profiling Added |
|------|-----------------|
| `scheduler.ts` | topologicalSort timing, action execution loop, arraysOverlap call counts |
| `reactive-dependencies.ts` | determineTriggeredActions timing, arraysOverlap call frequency |
| `navigate-to.ts` | asSchema wrapping timing, target get timing |

---

**Filed:** 2025-12-17
**Updated:** 2025-12-17
**Status:** INVESTIGATING - Profiling disproved O(n²) scheduler hypothesis. Real bottleneck is in action execution (16s for one action). Need to profile generateObject builtin and reactive updates next.
